# Gait and Action Recognition API

This repository contains the code for an API of my Final Year Project [Person Indentifier]() that uses Deep Learning models to identify individuals based on their gait and actions. The API accepts person video and it's background videp as input and returns predictions for the class of the person captured in the video.

## Overview

Gait and action recognition is a biometric identification technique that utilizes characteristics of an individual's walking style and actions to distinguish them from others. This API provides a convenient interface for utilizing pre-trained models to perform person identification based on their gait and actions.

## Features

- Accepts video data as input for person identification.
- Utilizes machine learning models trained on gait and action data.
- Provides predictions for the class (i.e., individual) captured in the video.
- Supports integration into various applications and systems through a API interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- Pre-trained machine learning models (to be provided separately or trained by the user)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Install dependencies using pip:
3. Place your pre-trained machine learning models in the `model/` directory.
